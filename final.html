	<br><br>

	<h2> BRAIN DUMP</h2>

	<p> 
		I am very excited for few things that are on my schedual in the next few months. 

		<br><br> 

		On the 18th I'll be taking a day trip up to dc all on my onw wich is very exciting. I have to get my turkish ID renewed and since that process takes only about an hour, i figured id just stay of there for a while for some fun alone time. 

		<br><br>

		Theres the possibilty of me getting premoted at work starting in june which is pretty neat

		<br><br>

		THEN I'll be flying to turkey on July 6th all by myself for the first time. Normally i make the trip with my mom but because of work i cant take more than a months worth of vaction.
